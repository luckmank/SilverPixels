# SilverPixels
Silver Pixels is an app that helps it's user to print directly from their phone or tablet on the photographic paper in the darkroom.
SilverPixels makes it quick and easy to make silver gelatin darkroom prints from a digital image using a mobile phone.

It is intended for people already familiar with darkroom printing. You will need to make an enlarger capable of holding your device and projecting the image onto photographic paper in a darkroom under safelight conditions, photographic paper, chemicals and trays to process the paper.

Instructions:
Set your device screen to maximum brightness. 
Select an image from your Gallery using the Pick Image button.
Set the Exposure timer slider to the correct exposure.
The screen will black out for 15 seconds to allow you to seat the device face down on the enlarger.
The device will display the image in the centre of the screen as a back-lit negative (tone inverted, monochrome and mirrored horizontally).
The screen will black out for 10 seconds to allow you to remove the device from the enlarger.
Remove the photographic paper and process normally (develop, stop, fix, wash, and dry).

Tips:
At any time press the back button to return to the control screen.
The app will remember the picture you previously selected until the app is closed.
Set the Exposure timer slider to 60 seconds to have time to perform tasks such as setting up the paper position, focus the image, and do an exposure test strip.
